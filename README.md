This is an unidirectional file sync application to Google Drive for multi-platform. It backups your files which are placed in a specified directory immediately when you change them.

## Installation
### Requirement
Lgdsync requires Java to run.

Author's environment:

* Java - 18.0.2 OpenJDK

### Download

### Google API Setting

You have to acquire a credentials JSON file from Google APIs console and place it in the `~/.config/lgdsync/${profile_name}` directory.

1. Create a project from Google APIs console
1. Select the project which you created

### Profile

You can pass a profile name with `-p` or `--profile` option. It enables you to use more than one Google account. If you don't pass the option, the profile name will automatically be `default`.
